# MySQL_EmployeeTracker

## Description

Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

This application is a backend solution for managing a company's employees using `node.js`, `inquirer`, and `MySQL`. The interface functions as a **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystem for non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in the database from the terminal. 


## User Story

```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

Design the following database schema containing three tables:

![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)

  
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:
  * Add departments, roles, employees
  * View departments, roles, employees
  * Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:
  * Update employee managers
  * View employees by manager
  * Delete departments, roles, and employees
  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department



* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries. You may wish to include a `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make development of individual features much easier.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a `constructor function` or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of `SQL JOINS` to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.

Open `terminal`
`npm init -y` to create a package.son file to store you dependenices.
`npm i` to install your NPM package manager and required dependencies.
`npm i inquirer`, `npm i console.table`, `npm i dotenv` to store environmental variables, 
& `npm i mysql` (server and database)
run command `mysql -u -root -p to connect to the database. Enter password to authorize.
`Welcome to the MySQL monitor`, next type `mysql> status` get status information from the server or `help` for more option.
confirm connection with database and server, then `quit` mysql. 
run command `node employeeTracker`, then `npm start` to answer the prompts.

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

**Important**: You will be committing a file that contains your database credentials. Make sure your MySQL password is not used for any other personal accounts, because it will be visible on GitHub. In upcoming lessons, you will learn how to better secure this password, or you can start researching npm packages now that could help you.


## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URL of the GitHub repository

* A video demonstrating the entirety of the app's functionality
